This is my work done during July Month' 2024 internship under codeAlpha.
1) Handwritten digit Recognition - used keras, pytorch and sequential model to identify which digit is in the dataset.
2) Credit Scoring Model - data is preprocessed using Standard Scaler, linear model used is Logistic Regression, archived accuracy of 82%
3) Predicted whether a person has diabetes or not. Used dataset of 768 people and analyzed 9 factors like Glucose, insulin etc. 78% accuracy is attained using linear kernel of SVM classification model.
